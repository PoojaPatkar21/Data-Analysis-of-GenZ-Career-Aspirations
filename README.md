# Project Overwiew
In order to fill the gap between the rising career aspirations of Gen Z and the Employer norms, the organisations need to adapt their strategies and company policies. There is a need to create a cool, flexible, and ethical workplace culture that resonates with Gen Z values. Employers should regularly revise compensation packages to ensure they meet the high financial expectations of Gen Z. Employers should innovate in employee engagement by integrating social and co-curricular activities that appeal to Gen Z interests.

# Introduction
The project titled "Career Aspirations of Gen Z" explores the dynamic career preferences and aspirations of the new generation entering the workforce. Data collection was carried out through online survey forms, gathering insights directly from Gen Z individuals. The project involved multiple stages, starting with data preprocessing to cleanse and prepare the data, followed by in-depth data analysis using Excel and SQL for extracting meaningful insights.

To enhance data handling and reporting efficiency, advanced Excel tools such as Power Pivot and Power Query were utilized. The data analysis culminated in the creation of a main dashboard and three functional dashboards, designed to provide an interactive and comprehensive view of the key trends. These dashboards visually represent various aspects of Gen Z’s career aspirations, job mobility preferences, and the factors influencing their career decisions. The project’s visualizations offer valuable insights that can guide employers in adapting their recruitment and retention strategies to meet the evolving needs of the Gen Z workforce.
